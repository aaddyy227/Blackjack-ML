# Progress: Blackjack Strategy Advisor (DQN Version)

## Complete
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Refactored training logic to use DQN with PyTorch (`train_dqn_policy.py`)
- ✅ Updated GUI advisor to load and use the DQN model (`strategy_advisor.py`)
- ✅ Maintained visual card selection interface in GUI
- ✅ Updated documentation (README, Memory Bank) for DQN approach
- ✅ Added PyTorch dependency to `requirements.txt`

## In Progress
None. Development of the DQN version core components is complete.

## To Do
- **Install Dependencies**: User needs to install PyTorch and other requirements.
- **Train Model**: User needs to run `python train_dqn_policy.py` to generate `blackjack_dqn_policy.pth`.
- **Test Advisor**: User needs to run `python strategy_advisor.py` and test its functionality and recommendations.

## Known Issues / Considerations
- DQN training can be sensitive to hyperparameters and might require tuning for optimal performance.
- Training time depends heavily on hardware (CPU vs GPU) and number of episodes.
- Advisor still only provides Hit/Stand recommendations.
- Unicode card symbols in the GUI depend on system fonts.

## Potential Next Steps
- Add support for more complex plays (double down, split) by modifying the action space and network output.
- Implement more sophisticated exploration strategies or hyperparameter tuning.
- Improve GUI aesthetics or add features like a full strategy chart display
