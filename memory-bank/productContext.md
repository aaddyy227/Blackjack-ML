# Product Context: Blackjack Strategy Trainer

## Problem Definition

Learning basic Blackjack strategy can be challenging. Players often make suboptimal decisions due to lack of knowledge or practice. Relying solely on strategy charts can be slow and doesn't build intuition effectively.

## Solution

This application will provide an interactive environment for users to:
1.  Play Blackjack hands.
2.  Receive immediate feedback on whether their decisions (hit, stand, double, split) align with basic strategy.
3.  Learn the correct plays in different scenarios through practice and guidance.

## Target User

*   Beginner to intermediate Blackjack players who want to improve their understanding and application of basic strategy.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive GUI:** The application should be easy to navigate and understand.
*   **Clear Feedback:** Strategy advice and corrections should be presented clearly and concisely.
*   **Engaging Practice:** The process of playing hands and learning should be interactive and helpful, not tedious.
*   **Focus on Strategy:** The primary goal is strategy learning, not complex betting or casino simulation.
