# Project Brief: Blackjack Strategy Trainer

## Core Goal

Develop a Python application to assist users in learning and practicing basic Blackjack strategy. The application should provide feedback on user decisions and potentially simulate games.

## Key Features

*   Implement core Blackjack game logic (dealing, hitting, standing, doubling down, splitting - TBD).
*   Incorporate basic Blackjack strategy rules.
*   Provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction.
*   Offer feedback to the user on their strategy decisions compared to optimal play.
*   (Optional) Game simulation capabilities.

## Scope

The initial focus is on setting up the project structure, implementing basic game logic, and developing the GUI foundation. Advanced features like complex strategies, betting systems, or multiplayer functionality are out of scope for the initial version.
